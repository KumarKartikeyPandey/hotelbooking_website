                        1. How do I search for a suitable hotel or apartment for my stay?<br>
                        It is very easy. At first type (enter) name of your destination/hotel including date of your
                        stay into the blue "Search box". Than just click on red button "Search". Immediately, all the
                        available rooms will show up including prices for whole stay (number of nights you filled
                        previously). You can also use our filters for more specific accommodation request as price per
                        room, star rating, hotel type, facilities etc. On the top of the page you can also sort the
                        accommodation based on popularity, price per room, guest rating and distance from center. You
                        can also select a suitable accommodation on the map located on our home page – all hotels are
                        listed there together with all the main attractions. This is quite helpful if you do not know
                        the destination much but wish to stay close to a certain attraction.<br>
                        2. How do I get to know which facilities / services each hotel offers?<br>
                        Please, have a look at the section Hotel basic information. In this section you will also find
                        the check in/out information. Hotel facilities / services are stated in Hotel basic information,

                        3. Is it possible to order an extra bed/baby cot and how much will it be?<br>
                        The extra bed/baby cots hotel policy is written in "Payment and cancellation conditions" in

                        therefore its necessary to always check it in order to find out if the extra bed will be
                        possible or not. Please note that the price for extra beds wil not be included in the total
                        price for accommodation. If you wish to add extra bed or baby cot, please write this request
                        into „Request box“ in the reservation form. Please note that any type of extra bed or baby cot
                        is upon request and has to be confirmed by the accommodation after your reservation.<br>

                        This is different for each city and also for any type of accomodation. For this information,
                        please always check the room conditions by clicking on the name of the room you are interested
                        in.<br>
                        6. How do I book accommodation?<br>
                        Booking is possible only by completing the reservation form on our web site. Please, select the
                        dates of your stay and type of rooms you have chosen. The system will show you the price for the

                        After completing and sending us your order form, you will get an automatic receipt e-mail
                        containing your order number. Within 30 minutes, you will receive Accommodation confirmation.
                        The Accommodation confirmation serves you as a voucher so please do not forget to print it out
                        and take it with you as it contains all the vital details (address of your hotel, contact phone
                        numbers and other instructions). In case that you requested in your order form any special
                        requests – ie. extra bed, non smoking room, parking etc, please always double check with the
                        hotel directly that they noted your request and are able to arrange it for you.<br>
                        8. Can I book your services by telephone, e-mail or fax?<br>
                        Unfortunately not. If you wish to make a booking, please fill in the order form on our website.
                        9. I made a reservation but did not receive any confirmation. What should I do?<br>
                        Before finalizing your reservation please double check your e-mail address because a mistake in
                        the e-mail address is the most common reason why our clients do not receive their confirmations.
                        In some cases, our e-mails can also end up in the “spam folder” so please check it as well. In
                        any case, please try to contact us by e-mail as we will be very happy to assist you and solve
                        the problem as soon as possible.<br>
                        10. Why do you require my cerdit card details for bookings?<br>
                        aK AUBERGE.com acts as an intermediary between our clients and hotels. Your credit card details
                        are required by hotels in most cases as a guarantee for your reservation in case of late
                        cancellation or “no-show”. The hotels have a right to preauthorize your credit card so please
                        make sure that your credit card is valid. Also please note, that if you book a Non refundable
                        room, this type of room has special conditions and your credit card will be charged in advance.
                        Please, always double check the payment and cancellation policy of the room you are interested
                        in before you proceed with the reservation.<br>
                        11. How do I pay for our accomodation?<br>
                        It depends on the room payment conditions. In most cases you will pay directly at the hotel
                        after your arrival. However, there are some exceptions - for example Non refundable rooms, so
                        please refer to the room conditions of each room.<br>
                        12. How do I cancel my booking?<br>
                        Please click on the link provided in the Accomodation confirmation and cancel your reservation.
                        13. What cancellation conditions do you have?When at least can I change the booking without
                        being charged any fee?<br>
                        Each room has its own cancellation policy and for this information always check the room
                        conditions. Generally, your reservation can be canceled or changed few days before your arrival.
                        However, there are some exceptions - for example „Non Refundable“ or „Special conditions“ rooms.
                        You can check the room policy if you click on the room type.<br>
